# InstaCart

InstaCart has released rich historical data on the grocery shopping habits of their customers. We will use this data to create profiles with predictive power which will help users discover products and stores manage planning and logistical challenges.

Check out the [Project Charter](CHARTER.md) for some background on this project's inception.

## Vision

To enrich the grocery shopping experience by bringing added convenience and guidance to shoppers, confidence and insight to suppliers, and a delightful interface to all.

## Mission
